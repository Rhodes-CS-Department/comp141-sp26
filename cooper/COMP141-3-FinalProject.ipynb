Since this project replaces your final exam, I expect you to spend at least 3 times the amount of time you normally spend on projects, including the proposal and presentation. Your project should require a **minimum** of 6 hours of work and more likely two or three times that. I have a rough idea of what you can pull off in that time."

That's OK. We're just starting with a vision for the project right now. You just start with the idea and we'll figure out together whether and how it's feasible. To get you started, here is a list of the topics that we will cover this semester. You can probably figure out what most of them do right now even if you don't know the specific syntax.\n",
