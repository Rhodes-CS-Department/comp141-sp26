    "# Introduction to Python Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "A _notebook_ is a way to interact with the Python interpreter and run Python statements and programs. In this class, we will use notebooks for a variety of assignments.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main advantages of this approach:\n",
    "1. All your work is saved in the cloud, on a server that is regularly backed up. You have access to your work from anywhere, and any device.\n",
    "1. Notebooks allow you to quickly experiment with code (like using the interpreter directly) but also allow you to save, edit, and re-run code easily (like writing programs).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notebook basics\n",
    "\n",
    "A notebook is essentially a document that interacts with Python. The document is comprised of __cells__. Each cell is one of two types: __markdown__ or __python code__. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) is a \"language\" for formatting text.  Here's a cheat sheet for [markdown syntax for notebooks](https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSGNPV_2.0.0/dsx/markd-jupyter.html)\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see an example of this by double clicking on this text to see the contents of this cell!\n",
    "\n",
    "When you are done looking at this markdown code, press `shift-enter` to only show the formatted text output."
