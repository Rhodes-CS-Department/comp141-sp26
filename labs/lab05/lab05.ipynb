A positive factor is a number between `1` and `num` that divides `num`. For example, the number 10 has 4 factors: 1, 2, 5, and 10. So calling `count_factors(10)` should return 4.\n",

    "Use a loop that runs until the parameter becomes equal to zero. Inside the loop, write `if` statements that test how big the number is (compared to the letter numeral values). Print the first numeral it is larger than or equal to, and then subtract that numeral's value.\n",
